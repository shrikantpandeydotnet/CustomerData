**CustomerData** 
CustomerData project is a test Application to add customer in the table.  We are using below technologies:

**FrontEnd Development:** 
Angular 8 using Dotnet Core  

**Backend Development:** 
Web Api using Dotnet Core  

**Data Access Layer:**  
Entity Framework. I am using public domain sql server so no need to do any changes to access the data. 

**Database:** 
Sql Server, Table Name = dbo.Customer 

**Prerequisite** 
* Dotnet Core Environment 
* Angular Environment (Node, Npm, Typescript, Ng2-sample-table installation) 

**Steps to Download the CustomerData Solution** 

- Use this git to clone the project. https://github.com/shrikantpandeydotnet/CustomerData.git or you can download the zip file as well by going to the link Clone -> DonwloadZip. 
- Build the solution. If you found any issue. It must be related to the package not installed. Install the package by using npm command.
- Go to the UnitTest Document and Perform the steps to test the application. 

**Note**
There are some additional links created by Dotnet Core Angular and Web API project. I have not removed those additinal pages/link for test project but in real scenario we need to remove additional code and build application on top of that.
